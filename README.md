# Shroom_ID


A machine learning application in aid of identifying British mushroom species


This is particularly useful for an initial guess as to what the species may be, for cross referencing


#### ______________ Notes on App _____________________


There are several apps and databases available online, 
however the tend to be very limited in the number of quality images and tend to have a huge number of classes, 
many of which you will not find in the UK


#### ______________ Notes on Dataset _____________________

There are mushroom image databases available online, however they tend to have enoumous imbalances between classes, 
with an extremely limited number of quality images per class

Additionally, many databases and applications do not specify geographic region, hence you will not find many of the species in the UK

For this database I a combination of my own images from foraging and use a web image scraping tool (https://github.com/DeliciousD/Image_scraper) 
I have developed to retrieve hundreds of images for around 150 UK mushroom species

________ further notes on dataset _____________

I hope future iterations of the database will weed out poor quality of incorrectly classified images

The dataset will be uploaded to kaggle

I intend to fuse the dataset with others and improve the image scraping capability

Additionally, the app, likely to be streamlit based, will allow users to upload images to the database

This is NOT purporting to be a one-stop solution for identifying mushrooms

Information given here MUST cross reference with AT LEAST two credible references (see below)

NEVER consume any wild mushroom unless you are certain of what it is
