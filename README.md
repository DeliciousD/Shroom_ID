# Shroom_ID


A machine learning application in aid of identifying British mushroom species


This is particularly useful for an initial guess as to what the species may be, for cross referencing


#### ______________ Notes on App


There are several apps and databases available online, 
however the tend to be very limited in the number of quality images and tend to have a huge number of classes, 
many of which you will not find in the UK


#### ______________ Notes on Dataset

There are several databases available online, 
however there is often an enoumous imbalance between classes and the number of images per class is often extremely low

Additionally, many of the databases do not specify geographic distribution and hence you will not find many of the species in the UK

Information given here MUST cross reference with AT LEAST two credible references (see below)

NEVER consume any wild mushroom unless you are certain of what it is
